# SimpleNeuralNetwork
A simple neural network that predicts the type of flower based on the length and width of its petals, the network has 2 layers input/output with 1 node for output and 2 nodes for input 

This model is not very reliable since the data set used to train it is so small, but since this is my first attempt at creating a NN from scratch it will surfice.

Numpy and Matplotlib are used, though neither are necessary since the methods numpy are used for could easily be replicated using Math and matplotlib is purely used as a way to visualise the cost reduction
